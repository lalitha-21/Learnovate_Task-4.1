    <p>Biryani can be cooked using one of two styles/techniques, pakki ("cooked") and kacchi ("raw").

        In a pakki biryani, the rice, marinated meat, and any vegetables are partially ("three-quarters") cooked separately, before being combined into layers in a cooking vessel. Different layers of rice may be treated with different spices (e.g., with dissolved saffron or turmeric give the rice different colors and flavors).
         
        The contents are then baked to complete the cooking and allow the flavors to combine (alternatively, the components may be fully cooked, and then simply combined by layering before serving.)
        In a kacchi biryani, layers of raw marinated meat are alternated with layers with wet, pre-soaked, raw rice (which may be treated with different spices as above), and cooked together by baking or medium-to-low direct heat (typically, for at least an hour). Cooking occurs by a process of steaming from the ingredients' own moisture: the cooking vessel's lid is sealed (traditionally, with a strip of wheat dough)</p>
